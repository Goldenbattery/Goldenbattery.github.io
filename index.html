					<h1>Personal Profile</h1>
				</div>
				
				<div class="sectionContent">
					<p>A university student who has been coding for years and am versed in using Excel. My communication skills make me approachable allowing for other members of the team to speak up, this being backed by my first-year university group project in which I broke the ice allowing the team to speak more confidently. I won't back down from a challenge and must finish what I start.</p>

                <article>
					<p>During my maths A-Level I gained the ability to use Excel, as it was pushed a lot as being favourable by employers. My Computer Science education also left me with some skills surrounding problem solving, in which I now believe are quite adept. Also, despite not getting the best grade in physics, I do believe that I have a firm knowledge surrounding the forces of the universe.</p>

                <article>
					<p>I am quite interested in video games, anime, and media such alike. Despite not taking these hobbies too seriously, I do still enjoy them a lot. Video games probably were the gateway to my interest into coding; however, I believe that I have grown out of exclusively wanting to make video games to any sort of program. It´s the challenge and puzzle of coding that interests me. I have continued to learn and use code to create small programs for my own amusement, in turn building my knowledge and love for the activity. In terms of social media, I wouldn´t call myself a big abuser. I do use YouTube quite frequently, however apps such as Twitter and Instagram have never enticed me, and I am not a massive fan.</p>
